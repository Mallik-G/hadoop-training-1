# Setup Instructions

## Directory Structure

For easiest results, I recommend to have the following directory layout

/home/cloudera
         |
         +---- hadoop-training
         |        |
         |        +----- exameple-01
         |        |
         |        +----- exameple-02
         |        |
         |        ...
         |
         +---- data
                  |
                  +--- weather
                          |
                          +--- 2011
